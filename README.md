Game for Ludum Dare 32 (An unconventional weapon)

## Goals of this project
Crysis like sidescroller game with the four elements Fire, Wind, Water and Earth.

## Warning
This game prototype was created in under 48 hours for Ludum Dare 32. The code quality is very bad, the use of static methods and attributes is insane. Please don't take this as a reference. Thank you.
